Declaring Interfaces
====================

An interface is a Contract for what a class can do, without saying anything about how the class will do it.

* An interface can have only abstract methods.
* All methods are implicitly public and abstract even if you do not type the keywords.
* The only methods with implementations are static.
* All variable defined in a interface are public, static and final. Interface cannot declare instance variables.
* Interface methods must not be static
* An interface can extend one or more other interfaces.
* An interface cannot implement another interface.
